# Skill Monitor

Closed-loop skill effectiveness monitoring. Reads session metrics,
computes per-skill signals, identifies what's working and what needs
improvement.

Inspired by the deploy-monitor-evaluate-improve feedback loop:
skills get better over time instead of staying static.

## Requirements

Requires `.claude/session-metrics/metrics.jsonl` from `/session-scan`.
If no data: suggest running `/session-scan` first.

## Usage

```
/skill-monitor                     # Dashboard: all skills
/skill-monitor --skill review      # Deep-dive on one skill
/skill-monitor --improve           # Generate improvement recommendations
/skill-monitor --window 30d        # Change comparison window (default: 7d)
```

## What Main Context Does

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **`--skill NAME`**: Focus on one skill (e.g., `review`, `plan`, `investigate`)
- **`--improve`**: Spawn analysis agent for improvement recommendations
- **`--window PERIOD`**: Comparison window (`7d`, `30d`, `all`; default: `7d`)

### Step 2: Load Metrics

Read `.claude/session-metrics/metrics.jsonl`. For each entry, extract
the `skill_effectiveness` field (added by compute-metrics.py v2).

Filter by window period. Count sessions with and without skill usage.

If no `skill_effectiveness` data exists in metrics: "Metrics were
computed before skill tracking was added. Run `/session-scan --rescan`
to recompute."

### Step 3: Compute Per-Skill Aggregates

For each skill found across all sessions, aggregate:

```
| Metric              | Computation                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Total invocations   | Sum of invocation_count across sessions        |
| Sessions used in    | Count of sessions containing this skill        |
| Action rate         | Weighted avg of per-session action_rate         |
| Avg post-errors     | Weighted avg of avg_post_errors                |
| Avg post-corrections| Weighted avg of avg_post_corrections           |
| Outcome distribution| Count of effective/friction/no_action/mixed    |
| Effectiveness score | action_rate - (0.3 * avg_post_corrections)     |
| Adjusted score      | For analysis/check skills, use lower thresholds |
```

**Skill type weighting**: Analysis and check skills (verify, triage,
perf, boundaries, pr-review, audit) have low action rates BY DESIGN —
their success is "found issues" or "confirmed things pass". Apply
adjusted thresholds:

| Skill Type | Flag Threshold | Expected Action Rate |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Execution (work, quick, full) | < 0.5 | > 0.7 |
| Analysis (perf, boundaries, audit, pr-review) | < 0.3 | 0.3-0.5 |
| Check (verify, triage) | < 0.1 | 0.0-0.3 |
| Knowledge (compound, learn, brief) | < 0.5 | > 0.5 |

Also compute **baseline friction** (avg friction of sessions WITHOUT
any skill usage) vs **skill friction** (avg friction of sessions
WITH skill usage). Delta = skill_friction - baseline_friction.
Negative delta = skills reduce friction (good).

### Step 4: Display Dashboard

**Dashboard mode** (no `--skill`):

```
## Skill Effectiveness Dashboard (last {window})

Baseline friction (no skills): 0.32 | With skills: 0.18 | Delta: -0.14

| Skill           | Uses | Sessions | Action% | Errors | Corrections | Outcome    | Score |
|-----------------|------|----------|---------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| /rb:review     | 12   | 8        | 92%     | 0.5    | 0.1         | effective  | 0.89  |
| /rb:plan       | 9    | 7        | 100%    | 0.2    | 0.0         | effective  | 1.00  |
| /rb:investigate| 5    | 5        | 80%     | 1.2    | 0.4         | mixed      | 0.68  |

Skills needing attention: /rb:investigate (high post-errors)
```

Flag skills using type-adjusted thresholds (see weighting table above).
Also flag if avg_post_corrections > 1 or outcome is predominantly "friction".
When displaying flagged skills, note if the flag is "expected" for the
skill type (e.g., verify at 0.24 is normal for a check skill).

**Skill deep-dive** (`--skill NAME`):

Show per-session breakdown for that skill, including session IDs,
dates, and individual outcome signals. If session reports exist in
`.claude/session-analysis/`, reference them.

### Step 5: Improvement Mode (--improve)

Spawn `skill-effectiveness-analyzer` agent:

```
Agent(subagent_type="skill-effectiveness-analyzer", model="sonnet", prompt="""
Analyze skill effectiveness data and recommend improvements.

Metrics data: {aggregated_metrics_json}

Sessions with friction outcomes: {session_ids}

For each underperforming skill:
1. Identify failure patterns from outcome signals
2. Propose specific skill/agent changes
3. Suggest new Iron Laws if patterns are systematic

Write recommendations to: .claude/skill-metrics/recommendations-{date}.md
""")
```

### Step 6: Write Output

Write aggregated metrics to `.claude/skill-metrics/dashboard-{date}.json`:

```json
{
  "computed_at": "2026-03-03T14:00:00Z",
  "window": "7d",
  "baseline_friction": 0.32,
  "skill_friction": 0.18,
  "friction_delta": -0.14,
  "skills": { ... },
  "flagged_skills": ["investigate"]
}
```

Append-only: never modify previous dashboard files.

## Iron Laws

1. **NEVER modify metrics.jsonl** — read-only from this skill
2. **Baseline comparison is mandatory** — raw numbers without baseline are meaningless
3. **Flag, don't judge** — surface data, let the human decide what to fix
4. **Evidence tags on recommendations** — every suggestion needs session citations

## Integration

```
/session-scan → metrics.jsonl (with skill_effectiveness)
       ↓
/skill-monitor → dashboard + flagged skills
       ↓
/skill-monitor --improve → recommendations
       ↓
Developer updates skills/agents → deploy → repeat
```
