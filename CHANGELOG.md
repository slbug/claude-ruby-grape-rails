Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- **RTK guidance is now external-integration only** — removed the long
  injected RTK command-preference section from `/rb:init` output and agent
  guidance. The plugin now treats RTK as an optional external Claude setup and
  asks users whether they want to enable it before pointing them to
  `rtk init -g`, instead of implying RTK detection alone can enforce command
  rewriting.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Skill `effort` frontmatter across all 49 shipped skills** — Workflow
  skills now use higher effort where orchestration matters, while lightweight
  skills use lower effort for cheaper, faster execution.
- **`PostCompact` hook (`postcompact-verify.sh`)** — Adds an advisory
  post-compaction reminder that points Claude back to active plan, scratchpad,
  and progress artifacts when needed.
- **`StopFailure` hook (`stop-failure-log.sh`)** — Persists normalized API
  failure context into the active plan scratchpad so resume flows can recover
  with better context.
- **Mixed-ORM and package-layout detection** — `detect-stack.rb` and
  `detect-runtime.sh` now emit and persist `DETECTED_ORMS`, `PRIMARY_ORM`,
  `PACKAGE_LAYOUT`, `PACKAGE_LOCATIONS`, `PACKAGE_QUERY_NEEDED`, and
  `HAS_PACKWERK` for init/workflow guidance.

### Changed

- **`/rb:init` stack detection** now relies on `detect-stack.rb` as the single
  source of truth instead of ad-hoc inline parsing.
- **Init / plan / research / work / review guidance** now identifies package
  ownership and the active ORM before recommending migration, callback, review,
  or enqueue behavior.
- **Iron Laws and injected guidance are now ORM-aware** for commit-safe
  enqueueing, distinguishing Active Record `after_commit` advice from Sequel
  transaction-hook patterns.
- **Packwerk and modular-monolith workflows** are now first-class in init and
  planning flows, including explicit user questioning when explicit package
  roots like `packages/*`, `packs/*`, `app/packages/*`, or `app/packs/*` are
  detected without explicit Packwerk signals.
- **Stack detection now distinguishes Rails components from a full Rails app**
  via `RAILS_COMPONENTS=true|false` and `FULL_RAILS_APP=true|false`, which
  helps mixed Grape + Rails-component repos avoid being mislabeled as full
  Rails apps.
- **Modular package detection is now more conservative and package-root
  focused** — discovery now keys off explicit package roots like `packages/*`,
  `packs/*`, `app/packages/*`, and `app/packs/*`, while avoiding broad nested
  Rails namespacing roots that produced false positives in ordinary apps. Once
  inside those explicit roots, detection is intentionally softer so lightweight
  packages still trigger ownership/boundary questions. Explicit Packwerk
  detection now depends on `packwerk.yml` rather than generic package
  manifests.
- **`StopFailure` recovery notes are phase-aware** — planning-phase failures now
  point back to `research/` and `scratchpad.md`, while work-phase failures keep
  the `plan.md` / `progress.md` resume flow.
- **Planning-phase recovery no longer depends solely on `ACTIVE_PLAN`** —
  active-plan fallback can now rediscover `research/`-only planning work when
  the marker file is missing or stale.
- **Sidekiq summary guidance is now ORM-scoped end-to-end** — the condensed
  checklist no longer reverts to unconditional Active Record / Active Job
  advice in mixed-ORM repos.
- **Explicit-root package detection is softer but still package-shaped** —
  supported roots now require actual code/package evidence instead of treating
  any arbitrary child directory as a package candidate.
- **Init template modular triggers now match detector policy** — generic
  `package.yml` alone no longer implies modular-boundary support outside the
  detector's explicit roots.
- **Runtime detection now persists `PRIMARY_ORM`** in `.claude/.runtime_env`,
  keeping the cached runtime state aligned with the detector output contract.
- **`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` adoption** was added selectively in workflow skills
  where explicit local reference paths improve reliability across plugin cache
  and install contexts.
- **`/rb:intro` tutorial wording** now clearly separates hook-backed automation
  from behavioral file-pattern guidance, so context-aware references are no
  longer described like guaranteed plugin infrastructure.
- **Contributor authoring guidance** now treats skill/agent length limits as
  targets rather than hard constraints, matching the practical size of some
  shipped orchestrators and deep reference-heavy skills.

### Fixed

- Normalized `file_path` handling across remaining validation/warning hooks so
  repo-relative hook payload paths resolve against the workspace root instead of
  silently no-oping outside the repo cwd.
- Hardened `/rb:document` pre-check guidance for shallow/new repos so the
  “recent Ruby files” gate no longer relies on a brittle `HEAD~5` pipeline.
- Made Iron Law regeneration fail when bounded replacement markers are malformed
  instead of logging success on unchanged content.
- Tightened explicit-root modular detection so supported roots require
  package-shaped evidence while still recognizing lighter Ruby/Grape package
  layouts.
- Rebalanced active-plan fallback so actionable work plans beat stale
  planning-phase directories when the `ACTIVE_PLAN` marker is missing.
- Improved planning-phase rediscovery recency so fallback uses real planning
  activity under `research/` and `scratchpad.md`, not just the `research/`
  directory node mtime.
- Aligned SessionStart stack reporting with `detect-stack.rb`, eliminating raw
  Gemfile grep false positives from commented-out gems.
- Added a minimal exact-Gemfile fallback in `detect-runtime.sh` so SessionStart
  still reports obvious stack/ORM signals when the Ruby-based detector cannot
  run.
- Tightened degraded-mode Rails detection so `detect-runtime.sh` no longer
  treats `gem 'rails'` alone as proof of a full Rails app when the Ruby
  detector cannot run.
- Removed misleading `zeitwerk:check --resolve` guidance from `/rb:verify`.
- Corrected `/rb:document` “new Ruby files” guidance to use added-file
  detection (`--diff-filter=A`) instead of matching any modified Ruby file.
- Expanded the float-for-money Iron Law detector to catch both `t.float` and
  `add_column ..., :float` migration forms, including parenthesized
  `add_column(...)` style.
- Rebalanced `security-reminder.sh` path matching so common security-sensitive
  filenames like `access_token.rb`, `payment_*`, and `permission_*` still
  trigger reminders while broad false positives like `tokenizer` /
  `administer` no longer do.
- Aligned pending-plan detection between startup and stop hooks by making
  `check-pending-plans.sh` look for real unchecked task lines instead of any
  unchecked checkbox text.
- Removed duplicate generic startup messaging by dropping the extra
  `check-resume.sh` fallback banner when SessionStart already prints the
  standard plugin-loaded message.
- Restored signal-safe cleanup for temporary `ACTIVE_PLAN.XXXXXX` marker files
  during `set_active_plan()` writes.
- Made `stop-failure-log.sh` self-heal stale lock directories after a short
  TTL, preventing abandoned locks from suppressing future failure logging.
- Scoped `debug-statement-warning.sh` away from the plugin's own generator and
  detector script directories so intentional `puts`-based tool output is not
  treated like production debug code.
- Closed unbalanced Markdown fences in `rb:research` output examples and the
  Ruby 3.4 features reference.
- Fixed generated/documented Iron Law references and examples:
  `generate-iron-law-outputs.sh` now supports `--help`, rejects unknown
  targets, and the canonical registry now links to the real YAML source;
  research/compound example docs no longer contain placeholder broken links;
  generated injector output no longer churns on wall-clock timestamps; and the
  generated README now points “full registry” at the canonical registry markdown
  instead of raw YAML.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **`/rb:init` stack detection** — Switched init stack/version parsing to exact
  gem-name matches so Rails no longer falsely resolves from gems like
  `rubocop-rails`. `detect-stack.rb` now emits resolved `GRAPE_VERSION`,
  `SIDEKIQ_VERSION`, `KARAFKA_VERSION`, and related version fields so injected
  `CLAUDE.md` headers prefer exact locked versions over degrading to plain
  `detected`.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- Merged `detect-runtime.sh`, `detect-betterleaks.sh`, and `detect-rtk.sh` into one SessionStart detector that exports runtime, tool, and hook-mode state
- Added hook modes: `default` for quieter startup / targeted secret scanning, `strict` for broader secret checks
- Fixed hook workspace-root resolution so installed plugins use the active project workspace instead of the plugin cache for `.claude/` state, formatter detection, and resume/plan tracking
- Promoted nested launch directories to the actual project root via git/worktree detection, with `Gemfile` / `.claude` ancestor fallback for non-git cases
- Refused filesystem root (`/`) as a valid workspace root and added non-empty root guards before `.claude` writes
- Threaded hook stdin payloads consistently into workspace-root resolution so `.cwd` from hook JSON is honored across SessionStart, resume, formatting, and active-plan flows
- Expanded post-write hook coverage from `Edit|Write` to `Edit|MultiEdit|Write`
- Hardened hook path handling, `.runtime_env` persistence, and sourceable runtime state generation
- Hardened active-plan state handling with tighter `.claude` confinement and safer marker access
- Clarified contributor testing guidance: `claude --plugin-dir ...` is the primary local working-tree workflow, while local marketplace install validates marketplace distribution behavior
- Added MySQL detection (`mysql2`) alongside PostgreSQL in runtime and init stack detection
- Switched marketplace plugin source to `git-subdir` so URL-based marketplace distribution can target `plugins/ruby-grape-rails/`
- Pinned the `git-subdir` marketplace source to `ref: v1.0.3` so marketplace installs fetch the released plugin revision instead of the moving default branch

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-23

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

**Review Artifacts** — Standardized review output paths and follow-up workflow:

- Reviewer agents now write per-agent artifacts to `.claude/reviews/{agent-slug}/{review-slug}-{datesuffix}.md`
- Consolidated review output now lives at `.claude/reviews/{review-slug}.md`
- `/rb:triage` now consumes consolidated review output and generates a follow-up plan at `.claude/plans/{slug}/plan.md`
- Review, triage, and root documentation were updated to reflect the standalone-review plus plan-follow-up model

#### Key Features

**Context Supervisor Pattern** — When orchestrators spawn multiple agents,
the context-supervisor (haiku) compresses worker output before synthesis.
Prevents context exhaustion with 3 compression strategies
(index/compress/aggressive) based on output size.

**Auto-Loaded Skills** — Skills load automatically based on file context:

- `.rb` files → ruby-idioms
- `*_controller.rb` → rails-contexts
- `app/models/*.rb` → active-record-patterns
- `app/views/*.erb` → hotwire-patterns
- `*_spec.rb` → testing
- `app/jobs/*` → sidekiq

**Plan Namespaces** — Each plan owns all artifacts in `.claude/plans/{slug}/`:

- `plan.md` — The plan with checkboxes as state
- `research/` — Research agent output
- `reviews/` — Individual review agent findings
- `summaries/` — Compressed multi-agent output
- `progress.md` — Session progress log
- `scratchpad.md` — Decisions, dead-ends, handoffs

**Runtime Tooling Integration** — Tidewave Rails integration for runtime operations:

- `mcp__tidewave__get_docs` — Version-exact documentation
- `mcp__tidewave__project_eval` — Execute code in running app
- `mcp__tidewave__execute_sql_query` — Direct database queries
- `mcp__tidewave__get_logs` — Read application logs
- `mcp__tidewave__get_models` — List application modules
- `mcp__tidewave__get_source_location` — Find source locations

**Filesystem as State Machine** — Each workflow phase reads from the previous phase's output:

```
/rb:plan → /rb:work → /rb:verify → /rb:review → /rb:compound
```

**Skill Effectiveness Monitoring** — `/skill-monitor` command computes per-skill metrics
(action rate, friction, corrections) and identifies degrading skills for improvement.
